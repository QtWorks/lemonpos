There is a more detailed install manual at the wiki, if you can use it instead.
There is also a little user guide at the wiki.

To compile and install:

* The first step is to make sure everything is up to date:
  
  sudo apt-get update
  
* Now that everything is up to date, we can install the needed kde4 packages   (kdelibs4, kdebase4, kdepimlibs4) and all of his
  dependencies (qt4...):
  
  sudo apt-get install  libqt4-dev libqt4-core libqt4-gui 
  
* Once you have KDE, and QT4 installed, we can install mysql:  
  sudo apt-get install mysql-client mysql-server
  
* Now we need to install everything else thatâ€™s needed for the compile:  
  sudo apt-get install build-essential g++ cmake gettext libqt4-sql-mysql kdelibs5-dev
  
* The next step is to download the source:
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/hiramvillarreal/lemonpos
  cd lemonpos
  mkdir build
  cd build
* Run CMake with your path to KDE4:  
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix`
  
* Run make to compile lemonpos:
  make
  
* After the compile is finished, you will need to install everything:    
  sudo make install
  
  
*  Now, copy the lemonrc file to your local .kde/share/config directory:
  
  cp lemonpos/src/lemonrc /home/USER/.kde4/share/config/ #Replace USER with your username.
  
* After installation, you need to create a database and user on mysql, to do this:

  cd lemonpos/database_resources
  cat lemon_mysql.sql | mysql -u root -p
  
* To restore a database with preloaded products and examples:
  mysql -u root -p lemondb < lemondb.sql  
  
* To start using lemon, type 

  lemon
  
  If for any reason lemon binary is not found, and if your kde4 install path is /opt/kde4 do:
  
  /opt/kde4/bin/lemon
  
 * The default and only user and password is (without quotation marks):
 
   username: "admin"
   password: "linux"

  By default, squeeze has security disabled, this to let you configure squeeze database settings in case
  you have installed the database server at a different computer.
